Logstash only logs *new* file/log data, so if you restart the 
watchdog you have to also pipe all of the current log input
into logstash via something like a TCP connection

Other than that, usage is to run the Jetty server, run logstash 
on the same host, and point logstash to where the jetty server 
is storing logs
